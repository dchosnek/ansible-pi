# Install Plex Media Server role

I used the tasks defined in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jonakoudijs/ansible-plex). I could not find this role on Galaxy, so I duplicated the tasks here. This role just installs the `plexmediaserver` package. All of the configuration is done manually by browsing to http://localhost:32400/web/.
